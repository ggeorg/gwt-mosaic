/**
 * Interface defining a component "decorator". Decorators allow a caller to
 * attach additional visual effects to a component.
 * <p>
 * Decorators use a chained prepare/update model to modify the graphics in
 * which a component is painted. The <tt>prepare()</tt> method of each decorator
 * in a component's decorator sequence is called in reverse order before the
 * component's <tt>paint()</tt> method is called. <tt>prepare()</tt> returns
 * an instance of <tt>Graphics2D</tt> that is passed to prior decorators,
 * and ultimately to the component itself. This allows decorators to modify the
 * graphics context before it reaches the component. After the component has
 * been painted, each decorator's <tt>update()</tt> method is then called in
 * order to allow the decorator to further modify the resulting output.
 * <p>
 * Decorators are not restricted to painting within the component's bounds.
 * However, they are clipped to the bounds of the component's parent. They are
 * not clipped to their own bounds because, due to the chained painting model,
 * it is not safe assume that a clip applied to a given decorator during the
 * prepare phase will be valid for subsequent updates, or even for painting the
 * component itself; though a component paints into a copy of the final prepared
 * graphics, it must still be clipped to the intersection of its own bounds and
 * the current clip (not the intersections of all preceding decorator prepare()
 * calls).
