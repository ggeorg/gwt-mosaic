= Introduction =

Box layout panels are used to arrange widgets sequentially: horizontal box layout panels arrange out their children horizontally from left to right, and vertical box layout panels arrange their children from top to bottom.

The Box layout panels support a number of options that allow a caller to customize the arrangement of child widgets:

  * `spacing` - the amount of space the box layout panel inserts between widgets.
  * `horizontalAlignment` - how the box layout panel aligns widgets on the x-axis.
  * `verticalAlignment` - how the box layout panel aligns widgets on the y-axis.
  * `fill` - whether or not the box layout panel should size all widgets to fill the available space; if `true`, horizontal box layout panels will make all widgets the same height, and vertical box layout panels will make all widgets the same width.
