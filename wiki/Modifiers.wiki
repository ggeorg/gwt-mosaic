= Introduction =

A modifier feature is a feature that has a child (which can be a group or features). A modifier will modify the display of its child features in some way.

= Details =

The basic set of modifiers are:
  * Clipped
  * Fade
  * Translator

== Translator ==

A translator moves the position of its children on the page by a relative delta-x and delta-y. The delta values can be animated over time, and smooth animations can be had with various tweening functions. Translators work on pre-computed values linked into a path by linear interpolation.

A translator is split into two piecces: the actual translator, and the translator model that holds the points.

Example:

{{{ }}}
