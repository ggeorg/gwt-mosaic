= Introduction =

The application module provides a simple framework for building GWT based applications. It is a small set of Java classes that provides infrastructure that's common to most GWT applications:

 * Management of application life-cycle, startup and shutdown
 * Support for loading localized resources, like strings, messages (TODO) and images
 * Support for loosely coupling Actions to their presentation

== Hello World based on {{{Application}}} ==

To write an application, you need to do just a few things:

 * Make your {{{EntryPoint}} class to extend the {{{Application}}} class and override its {{{startup}}} method. Your {{{startup}}} method should create and show the application's initial GUI.
 * In your {{{Entrypoint}}} {{{onLoad}}} method, call the static {{{Application.launch}}} method. This initializes the application module.
