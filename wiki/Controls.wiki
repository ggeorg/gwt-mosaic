= Introduction =

A [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-mosaic/source/browse/trunk/src/org/gwt/mosaic2g/client/scene/Control.java Control] feature has a visual representation. The provided primitive controls use GWT derived Widgets. A control in general can wrap any GWT Widget and it can be also used in combination with UiBinder.

= Details =

The primitive set of controls are:
  * Box
  * Text
  * Image
  * ImageSequence (TODO)

A [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-mosaic/source/browse/trunk/src/org/gwt/mosaic2g/client/scene/control/Box.java Box] displays a rectangular box (`<div>`).

A [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-mosaic/source/browse/trunk/src/org/gwt/mosaic2g/client/scene/control/Text.java Text] feature lets you display text or html.

An [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-mosaic/source/browse/trunk/src/org/gwt/mosaic2g/client/scene/control/Image.java Image] feature displays a single image using an url.

An ImageSequence is like an image node, except that it has a sequence of images that are shown, one per frame. This allows one to produce a cel animation. An image sequence can repeat, starting with any frame of the animation.
