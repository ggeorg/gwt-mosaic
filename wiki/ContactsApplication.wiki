#summary Sample application using Application module and PageBus.

= Introduction =

The application we want to build is the Contacts application from [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/tutorial/mvp-architecture.html Large scale application development and MVP]. Focus again is turned to decouple the view from the logic, this allows us to minimize our use of GWTTestCase and reduce the overall time spent running tests.

This application will allow users to view, edit, and add contacts to a list of contacts that are stored on the server.
